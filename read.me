🧭 Coordinate Transformation Tool
This is a simple and intuitive Streamlit app designed to convert coordinates between Cartesian, Cylindrical, and Spherical (Circular) coordinate systems. Originally created as a university project, it was later integrated into a larger suite of 17 mini-apps aimed at enhancing engineering and mathematical visualization.

🌐 App Features
🔄 Convert coordinates from:

Cartesian → Cylindrical & Spherical

Cylindrical → Cartesian & Spherical

Spherical → (Display only)

📐 Outputs formatted in matrix-style tables for better readability.

🧮 Uses numpy for mathematical computation and Streamlit for a clean interactive UI.
