# 🎓 Multi-Tool Coordinate & Engineering Calculator (8-Page Streamlit Project)

the public website for this project is : https://emft-home.streamlit.app

This repository contains **8 interactive Streamlit-based mini-apps** designed to simplify coordinate transformations, basic engineering computations, and visualizations. These tools were developed as part of a **university microproject** consisting of 17 total apps—8 of which were designed and implemented by **Ojasvi Vashisht**.

## 📘 About the Project

This microproject was created to support students in visualizing and computing key engineering and physics concepts. The apps were built using **Python**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Streamlit**, with a focus on usability, interactivity, and accuracy.

## 📂 Contents of This Repo

Here are the 8 apps developed by me:

| Page | Title                              | Description |
|------|------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Cartesian to Cylindrical & Spherical | Converts Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical and spherical systems |
| 2    | Cylindrical to Cartesian & Spherical | Converts cylindrical coordinates to Cartesian and spherical |
| 3    | Spherical to Cartesian & Cylindrical | Converts spherical coordinates and visualizes them |
| 4    | 2D Electric Field Lines             | Visualizes electric field lines using vector fields |
| 5    | Line Charge Electric Field          | Computes and visualizes E-fields due to a line charge |
| 6    | Point Charge Electric Field         | Visualizes E-field from a point charge in 2D/3D |
| 7    | Resistance Calculation              | Calculates resistance using Ohm's Law and formulas |
| 8    | Capacitance Calculator              | Basic parallel plate and spherical capacitor calculations |

> Each app is contained within a separate file inside the `pages/` directory of the Streamlit project.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name


Step 2: Install Required Libraries
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run Home.py
The Home.py file will act as the landing page for navigation if created. If not, you can directly run any page from the pages/ directory.

pip install streamlit numpy matplotlib scipy
